# Guidelines for Contributors

* Our objective is to help SE students learn a relevant topic quickly by locating good learning resources. 
  Therefore, this is meant to be a **_curated_** list of **_tried-and-tested_** learning resources, **_organized_** 
  in a meaningful sequence, with **_commentary_**.
  * We can include learning resources for any technical topic useful for SE students.
  * We should select the best external learning resources to include under a topic.
  * We should not include resources that we did not try ourselves. 


* Minimize duplicating content from other sources. Instead, give a short overview and provide a link to the 
  original source.
  * When reproducing content from elsewhere, acknowledge the source.

* When contributing, follow the [oss-generics process](https://github.com/oss-generic/process) where applicable.
