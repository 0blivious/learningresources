## PMD
PMD is a static analyser for Java, JavaScript, Salesforce.com Apex, PL/SQL, Apache Velocity, XML, XSL. The Copy-pate-detector ([CPD Find duplicated code](http://pmd.sourceforge.net/pmd-4.3.0/cpd.html)) is also included as add-on in PMD.

### Features
PMD supports checking rules for the following languages.

- [Java](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/pmd-java/index.html) (includes [JSP](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/pmd-java/index.html) with [limitations](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/pmd-jsp/index.html))
- [JavaScript](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/pmd-javascript/index.html)
- [Apex](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/pmd-apex/index.html)
- [PL/SQL](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/pmd-plsql/index.html)
- [Velocity](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.4.1/pmd-vm/index.html)
- [XML and XSL](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/pmd-xml/index.html)

PMD doesn't support checking rules sets for the following languages. Only Copy-Paste-Detector ([CPD](http://pmd.sourceforge.net/pmd-4.3.0/cpd.html)) is supported.

- [C++](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/pmd-cs/index.html)
- [C#](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/pmd-cpp/index.html)
- [Fortran](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/pmd-fortran/index.html)
- [Go](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/pmd-go/index.html)
- [Groovy](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/pmd-groovy/index.html)
- [Matlab](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/pmd-matlab/index.html)
- [Objective-C](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/pmd-objectivec/index.html)
- [Perl](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/pmd-perl/index.html) (only very basic CPD support)
- [PHP](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/pmd-php/index.html)
- [Python](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/pmd-python/index.html)
- [Ruby](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/pmd-ruby/index.html)
- [Swift](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/pmd-swift/index.html)
- [Scala](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/pmd-scala/index.html)

### Limitation

- Same as [CheckStyle](checkStyle.md), files will be examined one by one, there is no check to check multiple file at the same time (e.g. you cannot determine the full inheritance hierarchy of a class)

### How to use it

#### Download
PMD can be run in both Windows and Linux/Unix Operating System with the help of [Java JRE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html) 1.7 or higher. Refer to [How to install PMD and CPD](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/usage/installing.html) for more details.

#### Configuration
You can configure PMD to only include the rule sets your want (see [How to make a new rule set](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/customizing/howtomakearuleset.html)). In addition, since static analysis may produce false positive, you may want to [suppress the warnings](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/usage/suppressing.html) generated by PMD.

#### Command Line Usage
PMD can be lunched by using command line with various arguments. For detail, pls refer to [Running PMD via command line](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/usage/running.html).

#### Integration with Build Automation Tools
- [Ant task usage](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/usage/ant-task.html)
- [The PMD Plugin in Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/pmd_plugin.html)
- [Maven 1 PMD plugin](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/usage/maven-plugin.html)
- [Maven 2 PMD plugin](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/usage/mvn-plugin.html)

#### Integration with IDEs
PMD can be integrated with most of IDEs, inlcuding BlueJ, CodeGuide, Eclipse, eclipse-pmd, Emacs, Gel, IntelliJ IDEA, IntelliJ IDEA - QAPlug, JBuilder, JCreator, JDeveloper, JEdit, Maven, Maven 2, NetBeans, TextPad, WebLOgic Workshop 8.1.x. For instruction to integrate with those IDEs, please refer to [PMD integrations](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/usage/integrations.html).

### Available Rulesets
There is not predefined rules sets. You need to [define your rule sets](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/customizing/howtomakearuleset.html) by yourself.

PMD has categorised rules and organised them in different categories. For example, the rulesfor java has been categorised to 26 sections, which will help you quickly find the rules you want.

You may refer to the [Features](#features) section to view the rules according to your languages and [Configuration](#configuration) section to configure your rulesets.

### How does it work
Like [CheckStyle](checkStyle.md), PMD use [JavaCC](https://java.net/projects/javacc/) to parse your code to a [AST(Abstract Syntax Tree)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) and visited it recursively ([more details](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.4.1/customizing/howitworks.html)). You can view the syntax tree by using [bin/designer.bat](https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.5.3/customizing/howtowritearule.html)
